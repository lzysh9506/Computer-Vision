# CS 558 Computer Vision 

## Homework 1
- Use gaussian filter to smooth image
- Use sobel silter to get gradient descent and detect edges
- Use non-maximum supression to shrink the edge 

## Homework 2
- Apply RANSAC to find lines in the image with strongest support
- Apply Hough Transform to detect strongest points, then tranform points back to original image

## Homework 3
- Use coordinates and RGB values to describe pixels
- Apply k-means with multiple k values to cluster images
- Apply SLIC to cluster image and compare with the result of k-means

## Homework 4
- Build RGB hist, and computer nearest neighbour to classify images
- Apply k-means using RGB hist to detect skys in the image

## Final Simple Non-iterative Clustering (SNIC)
- See the file `Readme.pdf`
